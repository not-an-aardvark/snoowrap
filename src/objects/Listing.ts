/**
 * A class representing a list of content. This is a subclass of the native Array object, so it has all the properties of
 * an Array (length, forEach, etc.) in addition to some added methods. The Listing can be extended by using the
 * [#fetchMore()]{@link Listing#fetchMore} and [#fetchAll()]{@link Listing#fetchAll} functions.
 * Note that these methods return new Listings, rather than mutating the original Listing.
 *
 * Most methods that return Listings will also accept `limit`, `after`, `before`, `show`, and `count` properties.
 *
 * If you've used the reddit API before (or used other API wrappers like [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.org/en/stable/)), you
 * might know that reddit uses a `More` object in its raw JSON responses, representing comments that have been stubbed
 * out of Listings. In snoowrap, there are no exposed `More` objects; the objects returned by the reddit API are
 * stripped from Listings and are used internally as sources for the `fetchMore` functions. This means that in snoowrap, Listings
 * that contain Comments can be used/expanded in the same manner as Listings that don't contain Comments, and for the most part
 * you don't have to worry about the distinction.
 *
 * (Incidentally, if you encounter a Listing that *does* contain a `More` object then it's a bug, so please report it.)

   * is able to fetch 100 Comments per API call rather than 20, but all returned Comments will have no fetched replies by default.
   *
   * Internal details: When `skipReplies` is set to `true`, snoowrap uses reddit's `api/info` endpoint to fetch Comments. When
   * `skipReplies` is set to `false`, snoowrap uses reddit's `api/morechildren` endpoint. It's worth noting that reddit does
   * not allow concurrent requests to the `api/morechildren` endpoint by the same account.

   * also contain all elements that were in the original Listing. Under most circumstances, the newly-fetched elements will appear
   * at the end of the new Listing. However, if reverse pagination is enabled (i.e. if this Listing was created with a `before`
   * query parameter), then the newly-fetched elements will appear at the beginning. In any case, continuity is maintained, i.e.
   * the order of items in the Listing will be the same as the order in which they appear on reddit.
   * @example
   * r.getHot({limit: 25}).then(myListing => {
   *   console.log(myListing.length) // => 25
   *   myListing.fetchMore({amount: 10}).then(extendedListing => {

     * request if the desired amount of items is large.
