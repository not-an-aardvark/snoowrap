/**
 * The `More` class is a helper representing reddit's exposed `more` type in comment threads, used to fetch additional comments
 * on a thread.
 * No instances of the `More` class are exposed externally by snoowrap; instead, comment lists are exposed as Listings.
 * Additional replies on an item can be fetched by calling `fetchMore` on a Listing, in the same manner as what would be done
 * with a Listing of posts. snoowrap should handle the differences internally, and expose a nearly-identical interface for the
 * two use-cases.
 *
 * Combining reddit's `Listing` and `more` objects has the advantage of having a more consistent exposed interface; for example,
 * if a consumer iterates over the comments on a Submission, all of the iterated items will actually be Comment objects, so the
 * consumer won't encounter an unexpected `more` object at the end. However, there are a few disadvantages, namely that (a) this
 * leads to an increase in internal complexity, and (b) there are a few cases where reddit's `more` objects have different amounts
 * of available information (e.g. all the child IDs of a `more` object are known on creation), which leads to different optimal
 * behavior.
