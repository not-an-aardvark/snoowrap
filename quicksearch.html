"},"index.html":{"id":"index.html","title":"Index","body":" snoowrap Classes snoowrapRedditContentReplyableContentVoteableContentCommentRedditUserSubmissionLiveThreadPrivateMessageSubredditMultiRedditWikiPageListing snoowrap A fully-featured Node.js wrapper for the reddit API. (Documentation) Features snoowrap provides a simple interface to access every reddit API endpoint. For example, the method to get a user profile is just get_user(), and the method to upvote something is just upvote(). snoowrap is non-blocking; all of its API calls are asynchronous and return bluebird Promises. This means that you can handle concurrent requests however you want to, and you can use snoowrap as part of a larger process without it holding everything back. Each snoowrap object is completely independent. This means that you can have scripts from separate accounts making requests at the same time. After you provide a token once, snoowrap will refresh it on its own from then on -- you won't have to worry about authentication again. snoowrap uses lazy objects, so it never fetches more than it needs to. snoowrap has built-in ratelimit protection. If you hit reddit's ratelimit, you can choose to queue the request, and then run it after the current ratelimit period runs out. That way you won't lose a request if you go a bit too fast. snoowrap will retry its request a few times if reddit returns an error due to its servers being overloaded. These features ensure that you can write less boilerplate code and focus more on actually doing what you want to do. snoowrap's methods are designed to be as simple and consistent as possible. So the following expression: r.get_submission('2np694').body...will return a Promise. So will this one: r.get_submission('2np694').author.name // --&gt; returns a Promise for the string 'DO_U_EVN_SPAGHETTI' // (this submission's author's name)The above will return a Promise for the author's name, without having to deal with callback hell or .then statements. You can chain multiple API calls together: r.get_submission('2np694').subreddit.get_moderators()[0].name // --&gt; returns a Promise for the string 'krispykrackers' // (this submission's subreddit's first mod's name)...or chain actions together with fluent syntax: r.get_subreddit('snoowrap') .submit_selfpost({title: 'Discussion Thread', text: 'Hello! This is a thread'}) .sticky() .distinguish() .ignore_reports() .assign_flair({text: 'Exciting Flair Text', css_class: 'modpost'})snoowrap works on Node.js 4+, as well as most common browsers. Examples'use strict'; const snoowrap = require('snoowrap'); /* Create a new snoowrap requester with OAuth credentials. For more information on how to get valid credentials, see here: https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/reddit-oauth-helper */ const r = new snoowrap({ user_agent: 'put your user-agent string here', // for more information, see: https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API client_id: 'put your client id here', client_secret: 'put your client secret here', refresh_token: 'put your refresh token here' }); // Alternatively, just pass in a username and password for script-type apps. const otherRequester = new snoowrap({ user_agent: 'put your user-agent string here', client_id: 'put your client id here', client_secret: 'put your client secret here', username: 'put your username here', password: 'put your password here' }) // That's the entire setup process, now you can just make requests. // Submitting a link to a subreddit r.get_subreddit('gifs').submit_link({ title: 'Mt. Cameramanjaro', url: 'https://i.imgur.com/n5iOc72.gifv' }); // Printing a list of the titles on the front page r.get_hot().map(post =&gt; post.title).then(console.log); // Extracting every comment on a thread r.get_submission('4j8p6d').expand_replies({limit: Infinity, depth: Infinity}).then(console.log) // Automating moderation tasks r.get_subreddit('some_subreddit_name').get_modqueue({limit: 100}).filter(someRemovalCondition).forEach(flaggedItem =&gt; { flaggedItem.remove(); flaggedItem.subreddit.ban_user(flaggedItem.author); }); // Automatically creating a stickied thread for a moderated subreddit r.get_subreddit('some_subreddit_name') .submit_selfpost({title: 'Daily thread', text: 'Discuss things here'}) .sticky() .distinguish() .approve() .assign_flair({text: 'Daily Thread flair text', css_class: 'daily-thread'}) .reply('This is a comment that appears on that daily thread'); // etc. etc. // Printing the content of a wiki page r.get_subreddit('AskReddit').get_wiki_page('bestof').content_md.then(console.log);For more examples of what can be done with snoowrap, take a look at the documentation. Live threadsReddit's live threads are different from most other content, in that messages are distributed through websockets instead of a RESTful API. snoowrap supports this protocol under the hood by representing the content stream as an EventEmitter. For example, the following script will stream all livethread updates to the console as they appear: r.get_livethread('whrdxo8dg9n0').stream.on('update', console.log);For more information, see the LiveThread documentation page. Important note on ES6snoowrap uses the Proxy object introduced in ES6. If your target environment does not support Proxies, snoowrap will still function. However, method chaining as described above won't work, so your syntax will need to be a bit heavier. Environments that support the ES6 Proxy object Node 6+ Chrome 49+ Firefox 18+ Edge Node 4 and 5 (requires the --harmony_proxies runtime flag to be enabled. e.g. node --harmony_proxies yourFile.js) Example of how Proxy support affects behavior: // This works in environments that support Proxies. // However, it throws a TypeError if Proxies are not available. r.get_submission('47v7tm').comments[0].upvote(); // ---------- // This is equivalent and works on all platforms, but the syntax isn't as nice. r.get_submission('47v7tm').fetch().then(submission =&gt; { return submission.comments[0].upvote(); });You can explicitly disable method chaining with r.config({proxies: false}). To include in a projectNode: npm install snoowrap --savevar snoowrap = require('snoowrap');Browsers: snoowrap is usable with module bundlers such as browserify. Alternatively, prebuilt versions are available: snoowrap.js snoowrap.min.js (80kB gzipped) When run in a browser, snoowrap will be assigned to the global variable window.snoowrap.

"},"snoowrap.html":{"id":"snoowrap.html","title":"Class: snoowrap","body":" snoowrap Classes snoowrapRedditContentReplyableContentVoteableContentCommentRedditUserSubmissionLiveThreadPrivateMessageSubredditMultiRedditWikiPageListing Class: snoowrap snoowrap The class for a snoowrap requester. A requester is the base object that is used to fetch content from reddit. Each requester contains a single set of OAuth tokens. If constructed with a refresh token, a requester will be able to repeatedly generate access tokens as necessary, without any further user intervention. After making at least one request, a requester will have the access_token property, which specifies the access token currently in use. It will also have a few additional properties such as scope (an array of scope strings) and ratelimit_remaining (the number of requests remaining for the current 10-minute interval, in compliance with reddit's API rules.) These properties primarily exist for internal use, but they are exposed since they are useful externally as well. new snoowrap(options) snoowrap supports several different options for authentication. Refresh token: To authenticate with a refresh token, pass an object with the properties user_agent, client_id, client_secret, and refresh_token to the snoowrap constructor. You will need to get the refresh token from reddit beforehand. A script to automatically generate refresh tokens for you can be found here. Username/password: To authenticate with a username and password, pass an object with the properties user_agent, client_id, client_secret, username, and password to the snoowrap constructor. Note that username/password authentication is only possible for script-type apps. Access token: To authenticate with an access token, pass an object with the properties user_agent and access_token to the snoowrap constructor. Note that all access tokens expire one hour after being generated, so this method is not recommended for long-term use. Parameters: Name Type Description options object An object containing authentication options. This should always have the property user_agent. It must also contain some combination of credentials (see above) Properties Name Type Argument Description user_agent string A unique description of what your app does client_id string &lt;optional&gt; The client ID of your app (assigned by reddit) client_secret string &lt;optional&gt; The client secret of your app (assigned by reddit). If you are using a refresh token with an installed app (which does not have a client secret), pass an empty string as your client_secret. username string &lt;optional&gt; The username of the account to access password string &lt;optional&gt; The password of the account to access refresh_token string &lt;optional&gt; A refresh token for your app access_token string &lt;optional&gt; An access token for your app Methods config( [options]) Retrieves or modifies the configuration options for this requester. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options object &lt;optional&gt; A map of {[config property name]: value}. Note that any omitted config properties will simply retain whatever value they had previously. (In other words, if you only want to change one property, you only need to put that one property in this parameter. To get the current configuration without modifying anything, simply omit this parameter.) Properties Name Type Argument Default Description endpoint_domain string &lt;optional&gt; 'reddit.com' The endpoint where requests should be sent request_delay Number &lt;optional&gt; 0 A minimum delay, in milliseconds, to enforce between API calls. If multiple api calls are requested during this timespan, they will be queued and sent one at a time. Setting this to more than 1000 will ensure that reddit's ratelimit is never reached, but it will make things run slower than necessary if only a few requests are being sent. If this is set to zero, snoowrap will not enforce any delay between individual requests. However, it will still refuse to continue if reddit's enforced ratelimit (600 requests per 10 minutes) is exceeded. request_timeout Number &lt;optional&gt; 30000 A timeout for all OAuth requests, in milliseconds. If the reddit server fails to return a response within this amount of time, the Promise will be rejected with a timeout error. continue_after_ratelimit_error boolean &lt;optional&gt; false Determines whether snoowrap should queue API calls if reddit's ratelimit is exceeded. If set to true when the ratelimit is exceeded, snoowrap will queue all further requests, and will attempt to send them again after the current ratelimit period expires (which happens every 10 minutes). If set to false, snoowrap will simply throw an error when reddit's ratelimit is exceeded. retry_error_codes Array.&lt;Number&gt; &lt;optional&gt; [502, 503, 504, 522] If reddit responds to an idempotent request with one of these error codes, snoowrap will retry the request, up to a maximum of max_retry_attempts requests in total. (These errors usually indicate that there was an temporary issue on reddit's end, and retrying the request has a decent chance of success.) This behavior can be disabled by simply setting this property to an empty array. max_retry_attempts Number &lt;optional&gt; 3 See retry_error_codes. warnings boolean &lt;optional&gt; true snoowrap may occasionally log warnings, such as deprecation notices, to the console. These can be disabled by setting this to false. debug boolean &lt;optional&gt; false If set to true, snoowrap will print out potentially-useful information for debugging purposes as it runs. proxies boolean &lt;optional&gt; true Setting this to false disables snoowrap's method-chaining feature. This causes the syntax for using snoowrap to become a bit heavier, but allows for consistency between environments that support the ES6 Proxy object and environments that don't. This option is a no-op in environments that don't support the Proxy object, since method chaining is always disabled in those environments. Returns: An updated Object containing all of the configuration values Type object Example r.config({request_delay: 1000, warnings: false}); // sets the request delay to 1000 milliseconds, and suppresses warnings. get_user(name) Gets information on a reddit user with a given name.

Note: This can only be used if the current requester was supplied with a client_id and client_secret. If the current requester was supplied with a refresh token, it will automatically create a new access token if any more requests are made after this one. Returns: A Promise that fulfills when this request is complete Type Promise Example r.revoke_access_token(); revoke_refresh_token() Invalidates the current refresh token. Note: This can only be used if the current requester was supplied with a client_id and client_secret. All access tokens generated by this refresh token will also be invalidated. This effectively de-authenticates the requester and prevents it from making any more valid requests. This should only be used in a few cases, e.g. if this token has been accidentally leaked to a third party. Returns: A Promise that fulfills when this request is complete Type Promise Example r.revoke_refresh_token(); oauth_request(options) Sends an oauth-authenticated request to the reddit server, and returns the server's response. Note: While this function primarily exists for internal use, it is exposed and considered a stable feature. However, keep in mind that there are usually better alternatives to using this function. For instance, this function can be used to send a POST request to the 'api/vote' endpoint in order to upvote a comment, but it's generally easier to just use snoowrap's upvote function. If you're using this function to access an API feature/endpoint that is unsupported by snoowrap, please consider creating an issue for it so that the functionality can be added to snoowrap more directly. Parameters: Name Type Description options object Options for the request. For documentation on these options, see the Request API. Supported options include uri, qs, form, headers, method, auth, and body. A default baseUrl parameter of this.config().endpoint_domain is internally included by default, so it is recommended that a uri parameter be used, rather than a url parameter with a domain name. Returns: A Promise that fulfills with reddit's response. Type Promise Example r.oauth_request({uri: '/user/spez/about', method: 'get'}).then(console.log) // =&gt; RedditUser { name: 'spez', link_karma: 9567, ... } // Note that this is equivalent to: r.get_user('spez').fetch().then(console.log) // ###### r.oauth_request({uri: '/api/vote', method: 'post', form: {dir: 1, id: 't3_4fzg2k'}}) // equivalent to: r.get_submission('4fzg2k').upvote() // ###### r.oauth_request({uri: '/top', method: 'get', qs: {t: 'all'}}) // equivalent to: r.get_top({time: 'all'}) credentialed_client_request(options) Sends a request to the reddit server, authenticated with the user's client ID and client secret. Note: This is used internally as part of the authentication process, but it cannot be used to actually fetch content from reddit. To do that, use snoowrap#oauth_request or another of snoowrap's helper functions. This function can work with alternate this-bindings, provided that the binding has the client_id, client_secret, and user_agent properties. This allows it be used if no snoowrap requester has been created yet. Parameters: Name Type Description options object | string Options for the request; these are passed directly to the Request API. Returns: The response from the reddit server Type Promise Example // example: this function could be used to exchange a one-time authentication code for a refresh token. snoowrap.prototype.credentialed_client_request.call({ client_id: 'client id goes here', client_secret: 'client secret goes here', user_agent: 'user agent goes here' }, { method: 'post', baseUrl: 'https://www.reddit.com', uri: 'api/v1/access_token', form: {grant_type: 'authorization_code', code: 'code goes here', redirect_uri: 'redirect uri goes here'} }).then(response =&gt; { //handle response here }) unauthenticated_request(options) Sends a request to the reddit server without authentication. Parameters: Name Type Description options object | string Options for the request; these are passed directly to the Request API. Returns: The response from the reddit server Type Promise update_access_token() Updates this requester's access token if the current one is absent or expired. Note: This function is automatically called internally when making a request. While the function is exposed as a stable feature, using it is rarely necessary unless an access token is needed for some external purpose. Returns: A Promise fulfills with the access token when this request is complete Type Promise Example r.update_access_token() × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.0 using the DocStrap template.

This is useful in cases where one wants to enumerate all comments on a thread, even the ones that are initially hidden when viewing it (e.g. long comment chains). This function accepts two optional parameters options.limit and options.depth. options.limit sets an upper bound for the branching factor of the resulting replies tree, i.e. the number of comments that are fetched in reply to any given item. options.depth sets an upper bound for the depth of the resulting replies tree (where a depth of 0 signifies that no replies should be fetched at all). Note that regardless of the limit and depth parameters used, any reply that appeared in the original reply tree will appear in the expanded reply tree. In certain cases, the depth of the resulting tree may also be larger than options.depth, if the reddit API returns more of a comment tree than needed.

Note: This function will only work if the requester is the author of this Comment/Submission. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description options.status boolean | string &lt;optional&gt; true Determines how the item should be distinguished. true (default) signifies that the item should be moderator-distinguished, and false signifies that the item should not be distinguished. Passing a string (e.g. admin) will cause the item to get distinguished with that string, if possible. options.sticky boolean &lt;optional&gt; false Determines whether this item should be stickied in addition to being distinguished.

This is useful in cases where one wants to enumerate all comments on a thread, even the ones that are initially hidden when viewing it (e.g. long comment chains). This function accepts two optional parameters options.limit and options.depth. options.limit sets an upper bound for the branching factor of the resulting replies tree, i.e. the number of comments that are fetched in reply to any given item. options.depth sets an upper bound for the depth of the resulting replies tree (where a depth of 0 signifies that no replies should be fetched at all). Note that regardless of the limit and depth parameters used, any reply that appeared in the original reply tree will appear in the expanded reply tree. In certain cases, the depth of the resulting tree may also be larger than options.depth, if the reddit API returns more of a comment tree than needed. These parameters should primarily be used to keep the request count low; if a precise limit and depth are needed, it is recommended to manually verify the comments in the tree afterwards. Both parameters default to Infinity if omitted, i.e. the resulting tree contains every single comment available.

Parameters: Name Type Description updated_text string The updated markdown text to use Inherited From: VoteableContent#edit Returns: A Promise that fulfills when this request is complete. Type Promise Example r.get_comment('coip909').edit('Blah blah blah this is new updated text') gild() Gives reddit gold to the author of this Comment or Submission. Inherited From: VoteableContent#gild Returns: A Promise that fullfills with this Comment/Submission when this request is complete Type Promise Example r.get_comment('coip909').gild() enable_inbox_replies() Enables inbox replies on this Comment or Submission Inherited From: VoteableContent#enable_inbox_replies Returns: A Promise that fulfills with this content when the request is complete Type Promise Example r.get_comment('coip909').enable_inbox_replies() disable_inbox_replies() Disables inbox replies on this Comment or Submission Inherited From: VoteableContent#disable_inbox_replies Returns: A Promise that fulfills with this content when the request is complete Type Promise Example r.get_comment('coip909').disable_inbox_replies() expand_replies( [options]) Expands the reply Listings on this Comment/Submission. This is useful in cases where one wants to enumerate all comments on a thread, even the ones that are initially hidden when viewing it (e.g. long comment chains). This function accepts two optional parameters options.limit and options.depth. options.limit sets an upper bound for the branching factor of the resulting replies tree, i.e. the number of comments that are fetched in reply to any given item. options.depth sets an upper bound for the depth of the resulting replies tree (where a depth of 0 signifies that no replies should be fetched at all). Note that regardless of the limit and depth parameters used, any reply that appeared in the original reply tree will appear in the expanded reply tree. In certain cases, the depth of the resulting tree may also be larger than options.depth, if the reddit API returns more of a comment tree than needed. These parameters should primarily be used to keep the request count low; if a precise limit and depth are needed, it is recommended to manually verify the comments in the tree afterwards. Both parameters default to Infinity if omitted, i.e. the resulting tree contains every single comment available. It should be noted that depending on the size and depth of the thread, fetching every single comment can use up a significant number of ratelimited requests. (To give an intuitive estimate, consider how many clicks would be needed to view all the comments on the thread using the HTML site.) Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description options object &lt;optional&gt; {} Properties Name Type Argument Default Description limit number &lt;optional&gt; Infinity An upper-bound for the branching factor of the resulting tree of replies depth number &lt;optional&gt; Infinity An upper-bound for the depth of the resulting tree of replies Inherited From: VoteableContent#expand_replies Returns: A Promise that fulfills with a new version of this object that has an expanded reply tree. The original object is not modified Type Promise Example r.get_submission('4fuq26').expand_replies().then(console.log) // =&gt; (a very large comment tree containing every viewable comment on this thread) delete() Deletes this Comment or Submission Inherited From: VoteableContent#delete Returns: A Promise that fulfills with this Comment/Submission when this request is complete Type Promise Example r.get_comment('coip909').delete() remove(options) Removes this Comment, Submission or PrivateMessage from public listings. This requires the authenticated user to be a moderator of the subreddit with the posts permission. Parameters: Name Type Description options object Properties Name Type Argument Default Description spam boolean &lt;optional&gt; false Determines whether this should be marked as spam Inherited From: ReplyableContent#remove Returns: A Promise that fulfills with this content when the request is complete Type Promise Example r.get_comment('c08pp5z').remove({spam: true}) approve() Approves this Comment, Submission, or PrivateMessage, re-adding it to public listings if it had been removed Inherited From: ReplyableContent#approve Returns: A Promise that fulfills with this content when the request is complete Type Promise Example r.get_comment('c08pp5z').remove() report( [options]) Reports this content anonymously to subreddit moderators (for Comments and Submissions) or to the reddit admins (for PrivateMessages) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options object &lt;optional&gt; Properties Name Type Argument Description reason string &lt;optional&gt; The reason for the report Inherited From: ReplyableContent#report Returns: A Promise that fulfills with this content when the request is complete Type Promise Example r.get_comment('c08pp5z').report({reason: 'Breaking the subreddit rules'}) ignore_reports() Ignores reports on this Comment, Submission, or PrivateMessage Inherited From: ReplyableContent#ignore_reports Returns: A Promise that fulfills with this content when the request is complete Type Promise Example r.get_comment('c08pp5z').ignore_reports() unignore_reports() Unignores reports on this Comment, Submission, or PrivateMessages Inherited From: ReplyableContent#unignore_reports Returns: A Promise that fulfills with this content when the request is complete Type Promise Example r.get_comment('c08pp5z').unignore_reports() reply(text) Submits a new reply to this object. (This takes the form of a new Comment if this object is a Submission/Comment, or a new PrivateMessage if this object is a PrivateMessage.) Parameters: Name Type Description text string The content of the reply, in raw markdown text Inherited From: ReplyableContent#reply Returns: A Promise that fulfills with the newly-created reply Type Promise Example r.get_submission('4e60m3').reply('This was an interesting post. Thanks.'); block_author() Blocks the author of this content. Note: In order for this function to have an effect, this item must be in the authenticated account's inbox or modmail somewhere. The reddit API gives no outward indication of whether this condition is satisfied, so the returned Promise will fulfill even if this is not the case. Inherited From: ReplyableContent#block_author Returns: A Promise that fulfills with this message after the request is complete Type Promise Example r.get_inbox({limit: 1}).then(messages =&gt; messages[0].block_author(); ); fetch() Fetches this content from reddit. This will not mutate the original content object; all Promise properties will remain as Promises after the content has been fetched. However, the information on this object will be cached, so it may become out-of-date with the content on reddit. To clear the cache and fetch this object from reddit again, use refresh(). If snoowrap is running in an environment that supports ES2015 Proxies (e.g. Chrome 49+), then fetch() will get automatically called when an unknown property is accessed on an unfetched content object. Inherited From: RedditContent#fetch Returns: A version of this object with all of its fetched properties from reddit. This will not mutate the object. Once an object has been fetched once, its properties will be cached, so they might end up out-of-date if this function is called again. To refresh an object, use refresh(). Type Promise Example r.get_user('not_an_aardvark').fetch().then(user_info =&gt; { console.log(user_info.name); // 'not_an_aardvark' console.log(user_info.created_utc); // 1419104352 }); r.get_comment('d1xchqn').fetch().then(comment =&gt; comment.body).then(console.log) // =&gt; 'This is a little too interesting for my liking' // In environments that support ES2015 Proxies, the above line is equivalent to: r.get_comment('d1xchqn').body.then(console.log); // =&gt; 'This is a little too interesting for my liking' refresh() Refreshes this content. Inherited From: RedditContent#refresh Returns: A newly-fetched version of this content Type Promise Example var some_comment = r.get_comment('cmfkyus'); var initial_comment_body = some_comment.fetch().then(comment =&gt; comment.body); setTimeout(() =&gt; { some_comment.refresh().then(refreshed_comment =&gt; { if (initial_comment_body.value() !== refreshed_comment.body) { console.log('This comment has changed since 10 seconds ago.'); } }); }, 10000); toJSON() Returns a stringifyable version of this object. It is usually not necessary to call this method directly; simply running JSON.stringify(some_object) will strip the private properties anyway. Inherited From: RedditContent#toJSON Returns: A version of this object with all the private properties stripped Type object Example var user = r.get_user('not_an_aardvark'); JSON.stringify(user) // =&gt; '{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;not_an_aardvark&quot;}' × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.0 using the DocStrap template.

As such, snoowrap assigns each fetched LiveThread object a stream property, which takes the form of an EventEmitter. To listen for new thread updates, simply add listeners to that emitter. The following events can be emitted: update: Occurs when a new update has been posted in this thread. Emits a LiveUpdate object containing information about the new update. activity: Occurs periodically when the viewer count for this thread changes. settings: Occurs when the thread's settings change. Emits an object containing the new settings. delete: Occurs when an update has been deleted. Emits the ID of the deleted update. strike: Occurs when an update has been striken (marked incorrect and crossed out). Emits the ID of the striken update. embeds_ready: Occurs when embedded media is now available for a previously-posted update. complete: Occurs when this LiveThread has been marked as complete, and no more updates will be sent. (Note: These event types are mapped directly from reddit's categorization of the updates. The descriptions above are paraphrased from reddit's descriptions here.) As an example, this would log all new livethread updates to the console: some_livethread.stream.on('update', data =&gt; { console.log(data.body); }); Example // Get a livethread with the given ID r.get_livethread('whrdxo8dg9n0') Extends RedditContent Methods add_update(body) Adds a new update to this thread.

This will not mutate the original content object; all Promise properties will remain as Promises after the content has been fetched. However, the information on this object will be cached, so it may become out-of-date with the content on reddit. To clear the cache and fetch this object from reddit again, use refresh(). If snoowrap is running in an environment that supports ES2015 Proxies (e.g. Chrome 49+), then fetch() will get automatically called when an unknown property is accessed on an unfetched content object. Inherited From: RedditContent#fetch Returns: A version of this object with all of its fetched properties from reddit. This will not mutate the object. Once an object has been fetched once, its properties will be cached, so they might end up out-of-date if this function is called again. To refresh an object, use refresh().

"},"Listing.html":{"id":"Listing.html","title":"Class: Listing","body":" snoowrap Classes snoowrapRedditContentReplyableContentVoteableContentCommentRedditUserSubmissionLiveThreadPrivateMessageSubredditMultiRedditWikiPageListing Class: Listing Listing A class representing a list of content. This is a subclass of the native Array object, so it has all the properties of an Array (length, forEach, etc.) in addition to some added methods. The Listing can be extended by using the #fetch_more(), #fetch_until, and #fetch_all() functions. Note that these methods return new Listings, rather than mutating the original Listing. Most methods that return Listings will also accept limit, after, before, show, and count properties. If you've used the reddit API before (or used other API wrappers like PRAW), you might know that reddit uses a MoreComments object in its raw JSON responses, representing comments that have been stubbed out of Listings. In snoowrap, there are no exposed MoreComments objects; the objects returned by the reddit API are stripped from Listings and are used internally as sources for the fetch_more functions. This means that in snoowrap, Listings that contain Comments can be used/expanded in the same manner as Listings that don't contain Comments, and for the most part you don't have to worry about the distinction. (Incidentally, if you encounter a Listing that does contain a MoreComments object, then it's a bug so please report it.) new Listing() Extends Array Members is_finished :boolean A getter that indicates whether this Listing has any more items to fetch. Type: boolean Methods fetch_more(options) Fetches some more items Parameters: Name Type Description options object Properties Name Type Argument Default Description amount number The number of items to fetch. skip_replies boolean &lt;optional&gt; false For a Listing that contains comment objects on a Submission, this option can be used to save a few API calls, provided that only top-level comments are being examined. If this is set to true, snoowrap is able to fetch 100 Comments per API call rather than 20, but all returned Comments will have no fetched replies by default. Internal details: When skip_replies is set to true, snoowrap uses reddit's api/info endpoint to fetch Comments. When skip_replies is set to false, snoowrap uses reddit's api/morechildren endpoint. It's worth noting that reddit does not allow concurrent requests to the api/morechildren endpoint by the same account. append boolean &lt;optional&gt; true If true, the resulting Listing will contain the existing elements in addition to the newly-fetched elements. If false, the resulting Listing will only contain the newly-fetched elements. Returns: A new Listing containing the newly-fetched elements. If options.append is true, the new Listing will also contain all elements that were in the original Listing. Under most circumstances, the newly-fetched elements will appear at the end of the new Listing. However, if reverse pagination is enabled (i.e. if this Listing was created with a before query parameter), then the newly-fetched elements will appear at the beginning. In any case, continuity is maintained, i.e. the order of items in the Listing will be the same as the order in which they appear on reddit. Type Promise Example r.get_hot({limit: 25}).then(my_listing =&gt; { console.log(my_listing.length); // =&gt; 25 my_listing.fetch_more({amount: 10}).then(extended_listing =&gt; { console.log(extended_listing.length); // =&gt; 35 }) }); fetch_all( [options]) Fetches all of the items in this Listing, only stopping when there are none left. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options object &lt;optional&gt; Fetching options -- see Listing#fetch_more Returns: A new fully-fetched Listing. Keep in mind that this method has the potential to exhaust your ratelimit quickly if the Listing doesn't have a clear end (e.g. with posts on the front page), so use it with discretion.
