"},"index.html":{"id":"index.html","title":"Index","body":" snoowrap Classes snoowrapRedditContentReplyableContentVoteableContentCommentRedditUserSubmissionLiveThreadPrivateMessageSubredditMultiRedditWikiPageListing snoowrap A fully-featured JavaScript wrapper for the reddit API. (Documentation) Features snoowrap provides a simple interface to access every reddit API endpoint. For example, the method to get a user profile is just getUser(), and the method to upvote something is just upvote(). snoowrap is non-blocking; all of its API calls are asynchronous and return bluebird Promises. This means that you can handle concurrent requests however you want to, and you can use snoowrap as part of a larger process without it holding everything back. Each snoowrap object is completely independent. This means that you can have scripts from separate accounts making requests at the same time. After you provide a token once, snoowrap will refresh it on its own from then on -- you won't have to worry about authentication again. snoowrap uses lazy objects, so it never fetches more than it needs to. snoowrap has built-in ratelimit protection. If you hit reddit's ratelimit, you can choose to queue the request, and then run it after the current ratelimit period runs out. That way you won't lose a request if you go a bit too fast. snoowrap will retry its request a few times if reddit returns an error due to its servers being overloaded. These features ensure that you can write less boilerplate code and focus more on actually doing what you want to do. snoowrap's methods are designed to be as simple and consistent as possible. So the following expression: r.getSubmission('2np694').body...will return a Promise. So will this one: r.getSubmission('2np694').author.name // --&gt; returns a Promise for the string 'DO_U_EVN_SPAGHETTI' // (this submission's author's name)The above will return a Promise for the author's name, without having to deal with callback hell or .then statements. You can chain multiple API calls together: r.getSubmission('2np694').subreddit.getModerators()[0].name // --&gt; returns a Promise for the string 'krispykrackers' // (this submission's subreddit's first mod's name)...or chain actions together with fluent syntax: r.getSubreddit('snoowrap') .submitSelfpost({title: 'Discussion Thread', text: 'Hello! This is a thread'}) .sticky() .distinguish() .ignoreReports() .assignFlair({text: 'Exciting Flair Text', css_class: 'modpost'})snoowrap works on Node.js 4+, as well as most common browsers. Examples'use strict'; const snoowrap = require('snoowrap'); // NOTE: The following examples illustrate how to use snoowrap. However, hardcoding // credentials directly into your source code is generally a bad idea in practice (especially // if you're also making your source code public). Instead, it's better to either (a) use a separate // config file that isn't committed into version control, or (b) use environment variables. // Create a new snoowrap requester with OAuth credentials. // For more information on getting credentials, see here: https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/reddit-oauth-helper const r = new snoowrap({ userAgent: 'put your user-agent string here', clientId: 'put your client id here', clientSecret: 'put your client secret here', refreshToken: 'put your refresh token here' }); // Alternatively, just pass in a username and password for script-type apps. const otherRequester = new snoowrap({ userAgent: 'put your user-agent string here', clientId: 'put your client id here', clientSecret: 'put your client secret here', username: 'put your username here', password: 'put your password here' }); // That's the entire setup process, now you can just make requests. // Submitting a link to a subreddit r.getSubreddit('gifs').submitLink({ title: 'Mt. Cameramanjaro', url: 'https://i.imgur.com/n5iOc72.gifv' }); // Printing a list of the titles on the front page r.getHot().map(post =&gt; post.title).then(console.log); // Extracting every comment on a thread r.getSubmission('4j8p6d').expandReplies({limit: Infinity, depth: Infinity}).then(console.log) // Automating moderation tasks r.getSubreddit('some_subreddit_name').getModqueue({limit: 100}).filter(someRemovalCondition).forEach(flaggedItem =&gt; { flaggedItem.remove(); flaggedItem.subreddit.banUser(flaggedItem.author); }); // Automatically creating a stickied thread for a moderated subreddit r.getSubreddit('some_subreddit_name') .submitSelfpost({title: 'Daily thread', text: 'Discuss things here'}) .sticky() .distinguish() .approve() .assignFlair({text: 'Daily Thread flair text', css_class: 'daily-thread'}) .reply('This is a comment that appears on that daily thread'); // etc. etc. // Printing the content of a wiki page r.getSubreddit('AskReddit').getWikiPage('bestof').content_md.then(console.log);For more examples of what can be done with snoowrap, take a look at the documentation. Live threadsReddit's live threads are different from most other content, in that messages are distributed through websockets instead of a RESTful API. snoowrap supports this protocol under the hood by representing the content stream as an EventEmitter. For example, the following script will stream all livethread updates to the console as they appear: r.getLivethread('whrdxo8dg9n0').stream.on('update', console.log);For more information, see the LiveThread documentation page. Important note on ES6snoowrap uses the Proxy object introduced in ES6. If your target environment does not support Proxies, snoowrap will still function. However, method chaining as described above won't work, so your syntax will need to be a bit heavier. Environments that support the ES6 Proxy object Node 6+ Chrome 49+ Firefox 18+ Edge Node 4 and 5 (requires the --harmony_proxies runtime flag to be enabled. e.g. node --harmony_proxies yourFile.js) Example of how Proxy support affects behavior: // This works in environments that support Proxies. // However, it throws a TypeError if Proxies are not available. r.getSubmission('47v7tm').comments[0].upvote(); // ---------- // This is equivalent and works on all platforms, but the syntax isn't as nice. r.getSubmission('47v7tm').fetch().then(submission =&gt; { return submission.comments[0].upvote(); });You can explicitly disable method chaining with r.config({proxies: false}). To include in a projectNode: npm install snoowrap --savevar snoowrap = require('snoowrap');Browsers: snoowrap is usable with module bundlers such as browserify. Alternatively, prebuilt versions are available: snoowrap.js snoowrap.min.js (78kB gzipped) When run in a browser, snoowrap will be assigned to the global variable window.snoowrap. If you want to avoid global state (or you're using two versions of snoowrap on the same page for some reason), use snoowrap.noConflict() to restore window.snoowrap to its previous value.

"},"snoowrap.html":{"id":"snoowrap.html","title":"Class: snoowrap","body":" snoowrap Classes snoowrapRedditContentReplyableContentVoteableContentCommentRedditUserSubmissionLiveThreadPrivateMessageSubredditMultiRedditWikiPageListing Class: snoowrap snoowrap The class for a snoowrap requester. A requester is the base object that is used to fetch content from reddit. Each requester contains a single set of OAuth tokens. If constructed with a refresh token, a requester will be able to repeatedly generate access tokens as necessary, without any further user intervention. After making at least one request, a requester will have the access_token property, which specifies the access token currently in use. It will also have a few additional properties such as scope (an array of scope strings) and ratelimitRemaining (the number of requests remaining for the current 10-minute interval, in compliance with reddit's API rules.) These properties primarily exist for internal use, but they are exposed since they are useful externally as well. new snoowrap(options) You should use the snoowrap constructor if you are able to authorize a reddit account in advance (e.g. for a Node.js script that always uses the same account). If you aren't able to authorize in advance (e.g. acting through an arbitrary user's account while running snoowrap in a browser), then you should use snoowrap.getAuthUrl and snoowrap.fromAuthCode instead. snoowrap supports several different options for pre-existing authentication: Refresh token: To authenticate with a refresh token, pass an object with the properties userAgent, clientId, clientSecret, and refreshToken to the snoowrap constructor. You will need to get the refresh token from reddit beforehand. A script to automatically generate refresh tokens for you can be found here. Username/password: To authenticate with a username and password, pass an object with the properties userAgent, clientId, clientSecret, username, and password to the snoowrap constructor. Note that username/password authentication is only possible for script-type apps. Access token: To authenticate with an access token, pass an object with the properties userAgent and accessToken to the snoowrap constructor. Note that all access tokens expire one hour after being generated, so this method is not recommended for long-term use. Parameters: Name Type Description options object An object containing authentication options. This should always have the property userAgent. It must also contain some combination of credentials (see above) Properties Name Type Argument Description userAgent string A unique description of what your app does. This argument is not necessary when snoowrap is running in a browser. clientId string &lt;optional&gt; The client ID of your app (assigned by reddit) clientSecret string &lt;optional&gt; The client secret of your app (assigned by reddit). If you are using a refresh token with an installed app (which does not have a client secret), pass an empty string as your clientSecret. username string &lt;optional&gt; The username of the account to access password string &lt;optional&gt; The password of the account to access refreshToken string &lt;optional&gt; A refresh token for your app accessToken string &lt;optional&gt; An access token for your app Methods &lt;static&gt; getAuthUrl(options) Gets an authorization URL, which allows a user to authorize access to their account This create a URL where a user can authorize an app to act through their account. If the user visits the returned URL in a web browser, they will see a page that looks like this. If the user clicks &quot;Allow&quot;, they will be redirected to your redirectUri, with a code querystring parameter containing an authorization code. If this code is passed to snoowrap.fromAuthCode, you can create a requester to make requests on behalf of the user. The main use-case here is for running snoowrap in a browser. You can generate a URL, send the user there, and then continue after the user authenticates on reddit and is redirected back. Parameters: Name Type Description options object Properties Name Type Argument Default Description clientId string The client ID of your app (assigned by reddit). If your code is running clientside in a browser, using an &quot;Installed&quot; app type is recommended. scope Array.&lt;string&gt; An array of scopes (permissions on the user's account) to request on the authentication page. A list of possible scopes can be found here. You can also get them on-the-fly with snoowrap#getOauthScopeList. redirectUri string The URL where the user should be redirected after authenticating. This must be the same as the redirect URI that is configured for the reddit app. (If there is a mismatch, the returned URL will display an error page instead of an authentication form.) permanent boolean true If true, the app will have indefinite access to the user's account. If false, access to the user's account will expire after 1 hour. state string &lt;optional&gt; A string that can be used to verify a user after they are redirected back to the site. When the user is redirected from reddit, to the redirect URI after authenticating, the resulting URI will have this same state value in the querystring. (See here for more information on how to use the state value.) endpointDomain string &lt;optional&gt; 'reddit.com' The endpoint domain for the URL. If the user is authenticating on reddit.com (as opposed to some other site with a reddit-like API), you can omit this value. Returns: A URL where the user can authenticate with the given options Type string Example var authenticationUrl = snoowrap.getAuthUrl({ clientId: 'foobarbazquuux', scope: ['identity', 'wikiread', 'wikiedit'], redirectUri: 'https://example.com/reddit_callback', permanent: false, state: 'fe211bebc52eb3da9bef8db6e63104d3' // a random string, this could be validated when the user is redirected back }); // --&gt; 'https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/authorize?client_id=foobarbaz&amp;response_type=code&amp;state= ...' window.location = authenticationUrl; // send the user to the authentication url &lt;static&gt; fromAuthCode(options) Creates a snoowrap requester from an authorization code. An authorization code is the code value that appears in the querystring after a user authenticates with reddit and is redirected. For more information, see snoowrap.getAuthUrl. The main use-case for this function is for running snoowrap in a browser. You can generate a URL with snoowrap.getAuthUrl and send the user to that URL, and then use this function to create a requester when the user is redirected back with an authorization code. Parameters: Name Type Description options object Properties Name Type Argument Default Description code string The authorization code userAgent string A unique description of what your app does. This argument is not necessary when snoowrap is running in a browser. clientId string The client ID of your app (assigned by reddit). If your code is running clientside in a browser, using an &quot;Installed&quot; app type is recommended. clientSecret string &lt;optional&gt; The client secret of your app. If your app has the &quot;Installed&quot; app type, omit this parameter. redirectUri string The redirect URI that is configured for the reddit app. endpointDomain string &lt;optional&gt; 'reddit.com' The endpoint domain that the returned requester should be configured to use. If the user is authenticating on reddit.com (as opposed to some other site with a reddit-like API), you can omit this value. Returns: A Promise that fulfills with a snoowrap instance Type Promise Example // Get the `code` querystring param (assuming the user was redirected from reddit) var code = new URL(window.location.href).searchParams.get('code'); snoowrap.fromAuthCode({ code: code, userAgent: 'My app', clientId: 'foobarbazquuux', redirectUri: 'example.com' }).then(r =&gt; { // Now we have a requester that can access reddit through the user's account return r.getHot().then(posts =&gt; { // do something with posts from the front page }); }) config( [options]) Retrieves or modifies the configuration options for this requester. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options object &lt;optional&gt; A map of {[config property name]: value}. Note that any omitted config properties will simply retain whatever value they had previously. (In other words, if you only want to change one property, you only need to put that one property in this parameter. To get the current configuration without modifying anything, simply omit this parameter.) Properties Name Type Argument Default Description endpointDomain string &lt;optional&gt; 'reddit.com' The endpoint where requests should be sent requestDelay Number &lt;optional&gt; 0 A minimum delay, in milliseconds, to enforce between API calls. If multiple api calls are requested during this timespan, they will be queued and sent one at a time. Setting this to more than 1000 will ensure that reddit's ratelimit is never reached, but it will make things run slower than necessary if only a few requests are being sent. If this is set to zero, snoowrap will not enforce any delay between individual requests. However, it will still refuse to continue if reddit's enforced ratelimit (600 requests per 10 minutes) is exceeded. requestTimeout Number &lt;optional&gt; 30000 A timeout for all OAuth requests, in milliseconds. If the reddit server fails to return a response within this amount of time, the Promise will be rejected with a timeout error. continueAfterRatelimitError boolean &lt;optional&gt; false Determines whether snoowrap should queue API calls if reddit's ratelimit is exceeded. If set to true when the ratelimit is exceeded, snoowrap will queue all further requests, and will attempt to send them again after the current ratelimit period expires (which happens every 10 minutes). If set to false, snoowrap will simply throw an error when reddit's ratelimit is exceeded. retryErrorCodes Array.&lt;Number&gt; &lt;optional&gt; [502, 503, 504, 522] If reddit responds to an idempotent request with one of these error codes, snoowrap will retry the request, up to a maximum of max_retry_attempts requests in total. (These errors usually indicate that there was an temporary issue on reddit's end, and retrying the request has a decent chance of success.) This behavior can be disabled by simply setting this property to an empty array. maxRetryAttempts Number &lt;optional&gt; 3 See retryErrorCodes. warnings boolean &lt;optional&gt; true snoowrap may occasionally log warnings, such as deprecation notices, to the console. These can be disabled by setting this to false. debug boolean &lt;optional&gt; false If set to true, snoowrap will print out potentially-useful information for debugging purposes as it runs. proxies boolean &lt;optional&gt; true Setting this to false disables snoowrap's method-chaining feature. This causes the syntax for using snoowrap to become a bit heavier, but allows for consistency between environments that support the ES6 Proxy object and environments that don't. This option is a no-op in environments that don't support the Proxy object, since method chaining is always disabled in those environments. Returns: An updated Object containing all of the configuration values Type object Example r.config({requestDelay: 1000, warnings: false}); // sets the request delay to 1000 milliseconds, and suppresses warnings. getUser(name) Gets information on a reddit user with a given name.

Note: This can only be used if the current requester was supplied with a client_id and client_secret. If the current requester was supplied with a refresh token, it will automatically create a new access token if any more requests are made after this one. Returns: A Promise that fulfills when this request is complete Type Promise Example r.revokeAccessToken(); revokeRefreshToken() Invalidates the current refresh token. Note: This can only be used if the current requester was supplied with a client_id and client_secret. All access tokens generated by this refresh token will also be invalidated. This effectively de-authenticates the requester and prevents it from making any more valid requests. This should only be used in a few cases, e.g. if this token has been accidentally leaked to a third party. Returns: A Promise that fulfills when this request is complete Type Promise Example r.revokeRefreshToken(); &lt;static&gt; noConflict() In browsers, restores the `window.snoowrap` property to whatever it was before this instance of snoowrap was loaded. This is a no-op in Node. Returns: This instance of the snoowrap constructor Example var snoowrap = window.snoowrap.noConflict(); oauthRequest(options) Sends an oauth-authenticated request to the reddit server, and returns the server's response. Note: While this function primarily exists for internal use, it is exposed and considered a stable feature. However, keep in mind that there are usually better alternatives to using this function. For instance, this function can be used to send a POST request to the 'api/vote' endpoint in order to upvote a comment, but it's generally easier to just use snoowrap's upvote function. If you're using this function to access an API feature/endpoint that is unsupported by snoowrap, please consider creating an issue for it so that the functionality can be added to snoowrap more directly. Parameters: Name Type Description options object Options for the request. For documentation on these options, see the Request API. Supported options include uri, qs, form, headers, method, auth, and body. A default baseUrl parameter of this.config().endpoint_domain is internally included by default, so it is recommended that a uri parameter be used, rather than a url parameter with a domain name. Returns: A Promise that fulfills with reddit's response. Type Promise Example r.oauthRequest({uri: '/user/spez/about', method: 'get'}).then(console.log) // =&gt; RedditUser { name: 'spez', link_karma: 9567, ... } // Note that this is equivalent to: r.getUser('spez').fetch().then(console.log) // ###### r.oauthRequest({uri: '/api/vote', method: 'post', form: {dir: 1, id: 't3_4fzg2k'}}) // equivalent to: r.getSubmission('4fzg2k').upvote() // ###### r.oauthRequest({uri: '/top', method: 'get', qs: {t: 'all'}}) // equivalent to: r.getTop({time: 'all'}) credentialedClientRequest(options) Sends a request to the reddit server, authenticated with the user's client ID and client secret. Note: This is used internally as part of the authentication process, but it cannot be used to actually fetch content from reddit. To do that, use snoowrap#oauthRequest or another of snoowrap's helper functions. This function can work with alternate this-bindings, provided that the binding has the clientId, clientSecret, and userAgent properties. This allows it be used if no snoowrap requester has been created yet. Parameters: Name Type Description options object | string Options for the request; these are passed directly to the Request API. Returns: The response from the reddit server Type Promise Example // example: this function could be used to exchange a one-time authentication code for a refresh token. snoowrap.prototype.credentialedClientRequest.call({ clientId: 'client id goes here', clientSecret: 'client secret goes here', userAgent: 'user agent goes here' }, { method: 'post', baseUrl: 'https://www.reddit.com', uri: 'api/v1/access_token', form: {grant_type: 'authorization_code', code: 'code goes here', redirect_uri: 'redirect uri goes here'} }).then(response =&gt; { //handle response here }) unauthenticatedRequest(options) Sends a request to the reddit server without authentication. Parameters: Name Type Description options object | string Options for the request; these are passed directly to the Request API. Returns: The response from the reddit server Type Promise updateAccessToken() Updates this requester's access token if the current one is absent or expired. Note: This function is automatically called internally when making a request. While the function is exposed as a stable feature, using it is rarely necessary unless an access token is needed for some external purpose. Returns: A Promise that fulfills with the access token when this request is complete Type Promise Example r.updateAccessToken() rawRequest(options) Sends an HTTP request Note: This function is called internally whenever snoowrap makes a request. You generally should not call this function directly; use snoowrap#oauthRequest or another snoowrap function instead. This method allows snoowrap's request behavior to be customized via subclassing. If you create a snoowrap subclass and shadow this method, all requests from snoowrap will pass through it. To ensure that all other snoowrap methods work correctly, the API for a shadowed version of this method must match the API for the original makeRequest method. This method is based on the API of the request-promise library, so if you do create a subclass, it might be helpful to use request-promise internally. This will ensure that the API works correctly, so that you don't have to reimplement this function's API from scratch. Parameters: Name Type Description options object Options for the request Properties Name Type Argument Default Description json boolean If true, the Content-Type: application/json header is added, and the response body will be parsed as JSON automatically. baseUrl string The base URL that a request should be sent to uri string The uri that a request should be sent to, using the provided baseUrl. method string 'GET' Method for the request headers object Headers for the request qs object &lt;optional&gt; Querystring parameters for the request form object &lt;optional&gt; Form data for the request. If provided, the Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded header is set, and the provided object is serialized into URL-encoded form data in the request body. formData object &lt;optional&gt; Multipart form data for the request. If provided, the Content-Type: multipart/form-data header is set, and the provided object is serialized as multipart form data. body object &lt;optional&gt; The body of the request. Should be converted to a string with JSON.stringify(). This is ignored for GET requests, or of options.form or options.formData are provided. transform function &lt;optional&gt; A function that is called before the response Promise fulfills. Accepts two parameters: response.body and response. This function should be called regardless of the status code of the response, and the returned Promise from makeRequest should fulfill with its return value. resolveWithFullResponse boolean &lt;optional&gt; false If true, a Promise for the entire response is returned. If false, a Promise for only the response body is returned. This is ignored if an options.transform function is provided. Returns: A Promise for a response object. Depending on options.transform and options.resolveWithFullResponse, the Promise should settle with either the response object itself, the body of the response, or the value returned by options.transform. The Promise should be fulfilled if the status code is between 200 and 299, inclusive, and reject otherwise. (If a redirect is returned from the server, the function should follow the redirect if possible, otherwise reject with an error.) A response object has 4 properties: statusCode (number) the status code of the response, body (object) the body of the response, headers (object) the parsed response headers, and request (object) an object of the form {method: 'GET', uri: {href: 'https://oauth.reddit.com/full/url'}} representing information about the original request. Type Promise Example const snoowrap = require('snoowrap'); class SnoowrapSubclass extends snoowrap { rawRequest(options) { // do custom behavior with `options` if you want, then call the regular rawRequest function console.log(`made a request with options:`); console.log(options); return super.rawRequest(options) } } const request = require('request-promise'); class AnotherSnoowrapSubclass extends snoowrap { rawRequest(options) { // send all requests through a proxy return request(Object.assign(options, {proxy: 'https://example.com'})) } } × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.2 using the DocStrap template.

With the expection of Listings, all content types extend this class. This class should be considered 'abstract', to the extend that JavaScript classes can be -- it should not be necessary to instantiate it directly. new RedditContent() Methods fetch() Fetches this content from reddit. This will not mutate the original content object; all Promise properties will remain as Promises after the content has been fetched. However, the information on this object will be cached, so it may become out-of-date with the content on reddit. To clear the cache and fetch this object from reddit again, use refresh(). If snoowrap is running in an environment that supports ES2015 Proxies (e.g. Chrome 49+), then fetch() will get automatically called when an unknown property is accessed on an unfetched content object. Returns: A version of this object with all of its fetched properties from reddit. This will not mutate the object. Once an object has been fetched once, its properties will be cached, so they might end up out-of-date if this function is called again. To refresh an object, use refresh(). Type Promise Example r.getUser('not_an_aardvark').fetch().then(userInfo =&gt; { console.log(userInfo.name); // 'not_an_aardvark' console.log(userInfo.created_utc); // 1419104352 }); r.getComment('d1xchqn').fetch().then(comment =&gt; comment.body).then(console.log) // =&gt; 'This is a little too interesting for my liking' // In environments that support ES2015 Proxies, the above line is equivalent to: r.getComment('d1xchqn').body.then(console.log); // =&gt; 'This is a little too interesting for my liking' refresh() Refreshes this content. Returns: A newly-fetched version of this content Type Promise Example var someComment = r.getComment('cmfkyus'); var initialCommentBody = some_comment.fetch().then(comment =&gt; comment.body); setTimeout(() =&gt; { someComment.refresh().then(refreshedComment =&gt; { if (initialCommentBody.value() !== refreshedComment.body) { console.log('This comment has changed since 10 seconds ago.'); } }); }, 10000); toJSON() Returns a stringifyable version of this object. It is usually not necessary to call this method directly; simply running JSON.stringify(some_object) will strip the private properties anyway. Returns: A version of this object with all the private properties stripped Type object Example var user = r.getUser('not_an_aardvark'); JSON.stringify(user) // =&gt; '{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;not_an_aardvark&quot;}' × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.2 using the DocStrap template.

(This takes the form of a new Comment if this object is a Submission/Comment, or a new PrivateMessage if this object is a PrivateMessage.) Parameters: Name Type Description text string The content of the reply, in raw markdown text Returns: A Promise that fulfills with the newly-created reply Type Promise Example r.getSubmission('4e60m3').reply('This was an interesting post. Thanks.'); blockAuthor() Blocks the author of this content. Note: In order for this function to have an effect, this item must be in the authenticated account's inbox or modmail somewhere. The reddit API gives no outward indication of whether this condition is satisfied, so the returned Promise will fulfill even if this is not the case. Returns: A Promise that fulfills with this message after the request is complete Type Promise Example r.getInbox({limit: 1}).then(messages =&gt; messages[0].blockAuthor(); ); fetch() Fetches this content from reddit. This will not mutate the original content object; all Promise properties will remain as Promises after the content has been fetched. However, the information on this object will be cached, so it may become out-of-date with the content on reddit. To clear the cache and fetch this object from reddit again, use refresh(). If snoowrap is running in an environment that supports ES2015 Proxies (e.g. Chrome 49+), then fetch() will get automatically called when an unknown property is accessed on an unfetched content object. Inherited From: RedditContent#fetch Returns: A version of this object with all of its fetched properties from reddit. This will not mutate the object. Once an object has been fetched once, its properties will be cached, so they might end up out-of-date if this function is called again. To refresh an object, use refresh(). Type Promise Example r.getUser('not_an_aardvark').fetch().then(userInfo =&gt; { console.log(userInfo.name); // 'not_an_aardvark' console.log(userInfo.created_utc); // 1419104352 }); r.getComment('d1xchqn').fetch().then(comment =&gt; comment.body).then(console.log) // =&gt; 'This is a little too interesting for my liking' // In environments that support ES2015 Proxies, the above line is equivalent to: r.getComment('d1xchqn').body.then(console.log); // =&gt; 'This is a little too interesting for my liking' refresh() Refreshes this content.

Note: This function will only work if the requester is the author of this Comment/Submission. Parameters: Name Type Description options object Properties Name Type Argument Default Description status boolean | string &lt;optional&gt; true Determines how the item should be distinguished. true (default) signifies that the item should be moderator-distinguished, and false signifies that the item should not be distinguished. Passing a string (e.g. admin) will cause the item to get distinguished with that string, if possible. sticky boolean &lt;optional&gt; false Determines whether this item should be stickied in addition to being distinguished. (This only applies to comments; to sticky a submission, use Submission#sticky instead.) Returns: A Promise that fulfills when the request is complete. Type Promise Example r.getComment('d1xclfo').distinguish({status: true, sticky: true}) undistinguish() Undistinguishes this Comment or Submission. Alias for distinguish({status: false}) Returns: A Promise that fulfills when the request is complete. Type Promise Example r.getSubmission('4e62ml').undistinguish() edit(updatedText) Edits this Comment or Submission. Parameters: Name Type Description updatedText string The updated markdown text to use Returns: A Promise that fulfills when this request is complete. Type Promise Example r.getComment('coip909').edit('Blah blah blah this is new updated text') gild() Gives reddit gold to the author of this Comment or Submission.

This is useful in cases where one wants to enumerate all comments on a thread, even the ones that are initially hidden when viewing it (e.g. long comment chains). This function accepts two optional parameters options.limit and options.depth. options.limit sets an upper bound for the branching factor of the resulting replies tree, i.e. the number of comments that are fetched in reply to any given item. options.depth sets an upper bound for the depth of the resulting replies tree (where a depth of 0 signifies that no replies should be fetched at all). Note that regardless of the limit and depth parameters used, any reply that appeared in the original reply tree will appear in the expanded reply tree. In certain cases, the depth of the resulting tree may also be larger than options.depth, if the reddit API returns more of a comment tree than needed. These parameters should primarily be used to keep the request count low; if a precise limit and depth are needed, it is recommended to manually verify the comments in the tree afterwards. Both parameters default to Infinity if omitted, i.e. the resulting tree contains every single comment available. It should be noted that depending on the size and depth of the thread, fetching every single comment can use up a significant number of ratelimited requests. (To give an intuitive estimate, consider how many clicks would be needed to view all the comments on the thread using the HTML site.) Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description options object &lt;optional&gt; {} Properties Name Type Argument Default Description limit number &lt;optional&gt; Infinity An upper-bound for the branching factor of the resulting tree of replies depth number &lt;optional&gt; Infinity An upper-bound for the depth of the resulting tree of replies Returns: A Promise that fulfills with a new version of this object that has an expanded reply tree.

Parameters: Name Type Description text string The content of the reply, in raw markdown text Inherited From: ReplyableContent#reply Returns: A Promise that fulfills with the newly-created reply Type Promise Example r.getSubmission('4e60m3').reply('This was an interesting post. Thanks.'); blockAuthor() Blocks the author of this content. Note: In order for this function to have an effect, this item must be in the authenticated account's inbox or modmail somewhere. The reddit API gives no outward indication of whether this condition is satisfied, so the returned Promise will fulfill even if this is not the case. Inherited From: ReplyableContent#blockAuthor Returns: A Promise that fulfills with this message after the request is complete Type Promise Example r.getInbox({limit: 1}).then(messages =&gt; messages[0].blockAuthor(); ); fetch() Fetches this content from reddit. This will not mutate the original content object; all Promise properties will remain as Promises after the content has been fetched. However, the information on this object will be cached, so it may become out-of-date with the content on reddit. To clear the cache and fetch this object from reddit again, use refresh(). If snoowrap is running in an environment that supports ES2015 Proxies (e.g. Chrome 49+), then fetch() will get automatically called when an unknown property is accessed on an unfetched content object. Inherited From: RedditContent#fetch Returns: A version of this object with all of its fetched properties from reddit. This will not mutate the object. Once an object has been fetched once, its properties will be cached, so they might end up out-of-date if this function is called again. To refresh an object, use refresh(). Type Promise Example r.getUser('not_an_aardvark').fetch().then(userInfo =&gt; { console.log(userInfo.name); // 'not_an_aardvark' console.log(userInfo.created_utc); // 1419104352 }); r.getComment('d1xchqn').fetch().then(comment =&gt; comment.body).then(console.log) // =&gt; 'This is a little too interesting for my liking' // In environments that support ES2015 Proxies, the above line is equivalent to: r.getComment('d1xchqn').body.then(console.log); // =&gt; 'This is a little too interesting for my liking' refresh() Refreshes this content. Inherited From: RedditContent#refresh Returns: A newly-fetched version of this content Type Promise Example var someComment = r.getComment('cmfkyus'); var initialCommentBody = some_comment.fetch().then(comment =&gt; comment.body); setTimeout(() =&gt; { someComment.refresh().then(refreshedComment =&gt; { if (initialCommentBody.value() !== refreshedComment.body) { console.log('This comment has changed since 10 seconds ago.'); } }); }, 10000); toJSON() Returns a stringifyable version of this object. It is usually not necessary to call this method directly; simply running JSON.stringify(some_object) will strip the private properties anyway. Inherited From: RedditContent#toJSON Returns: A version of this object with all the private properties stripped Type object Example var user = r.getUser('not_an_aardvark'); JSON.stringify(user) // =&gt; '{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;not_an_aardvark&quot;}' × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.2 using the DocStrap template.

This is useful in cases where one wants to enumerate all comments on a thread, even the ones that are initially hidden when viewing it (e.g. long comment chains). This function accepts two optional parameters options.limit and options.depth. options.limit sets an upper bound for the branching factor of the resulting replies tree, i.e. the number of comments that are fetched in reply to any given item. options.depth sets an upper bound for the depth of the resulting replies tree (where a depth of 0 signifies that no replies should be fetched at all). Note that regardless of the limit and depth parameters used, any reply that appeared in the original reply tree will appear in the expanded reply tree. In certain cases, the depth of the resulting tree may also be larger than options.depth, if the reddit API returns more of a comment tree than needed. These parameters should primarily be used to keep the request count low; if a precise limit and depth are needed, it is recommended to manually verify the comments in the tree afterwards. Both parameters default to Infinity if omitted, i.e. the resulting tree contains every single comment available. It should be noted that depending on the size and depth of the thread, fetching every single comment can use up a significant number of ratelimited requests. (To give an intuitive estimate, consider how many clicks would be needed to view all the comments on the thread using the HTML site.) Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description options object &lt;optional&gt; {} Properties Name Type Argument Default Description limit number &lt;optional&gt; Infinity An upper-bound for the branching factor of the resulting tree of replies depth number &lt;optional&gt; Infinity An upper-bound for the depth of the resulting tree of replies Inherited From: VoteableContent#expandReplies Returns: A Promise that fulfills with a new version of this object that has an expanded reply tree.

As such, snoowrap assigns each fetched LiveThread object a stream property, which takes the form of an EventEmitter. To listen for new thread updates, simply add listeners to that emitter. The following events can be emitted: update: Occurs when a new update has been posted in this thread. Emits a LiveUpdate object containing information about the new update. activity: Occurs periodically when the viewer count for this thread changes. settings: Occurs when the thread's settings change. Emits an object containing the new settings. delete: Occurs when an update has been deleted. Emits the ID of the deleted update. strike: Occurs when an update has been striken (marked incorrect and crossed out). Emits the ID of the striken update. embeds_ready: Occurs when embedded media is now available for a previously-posted update. complete: Occurs when this LiveThread has been marked as complete, and no more updates will be sent. (Note: These event types are mapped directly from reddit's categorization of the updates. The descriptions above are paraphrased from reddit's descriptions here.)

Returns: undefined Example var myThread = r.getLivethread('whrdxo8dg9n0'); myThread.stream.on('update', content =&gt; { console.log(content); myThread.closeStream(); }) fetch() Fetches this content from reddit. This will not mutate the original content object; all Promise properties will remain as Promises after the content has been fetched. However, the information on this object will be cached, so it may become out-of-date with the content on reddit. To clear the cache and fetch this object from reddit again, use refresh(). If snoowrap is running in an environment that supports ES2015 Proxies (e.g. Chrome 49+), then fetch() will get automatically called when an unknown property is accessed on an unfetched content object. Inherited From: RedditContent#fetch Returns: A version of this object with all of its fetched properties from reddit. This will not mutate the object. Once an object has been fetched once, its properties will be cached, so they might end up out-of-date if this function is called again. To refresh an object, use refresh(). Type Promise Example r.getUser('not_an_aardvark').fetch().then(userInfo =&gt; { console.log(userInfo.name); // 'not_an_aardvark' console.log(userInfo.created_utc); // 1419104352 }); r.getComment('d1xchqn').fetch().then(comment =&gt; comment.body).then(console.log) // =&gt; 'This is a little too interesting for my liking' // In environments that support ES2015 Proxies, the above line is equivalent to: r.getComment('d1xchqn').body.then(console.log); // =&gt; 'This is a little too interesting for my liking' refresh() Refreshes this content. Inherited From: RedditContent#refresh Returns: A newly-fetched version of this content Type Promise Example var someComment = r.getComment('cmfkyus'); var initialCommentBody = some_comment.fetch().then(comment =&gt; comment.body); setTimeout(() =&gt; { someComment.refresh().then(refreshedComment =&gt; { if (initialCommentBody.value() !== refreshedComment.body) { console.log('This comment has changed since 10 seconds ago.'); } }); }, 10000); toJSON() Returns a stringifyable version of this object. It is usually not necessary to call this method directly; simply running JSON.stringify(some_object) will strip the private properties anyway. Inherited From: RedditContent#toJSON Returns: A version of this object with all the private properties stripped Type object Example var user = r.getUser('not_an_aardvark'); JSON.stringify(user) // =&gt; '{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;not_an_aardvark&quot;}' × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.2 using the DocStrap template.

This will not mutate the original content object; all Promise properties will remain as Promises after the content has been fetched. However, the information on this object will be cached, so it may become out-of-date with the content on reddit. To clear the cache and fetch this object from reddit again, use refresh(). If snoowrap is running in an environment that supports ES2015 Proxies (e.g. Chrome 49+), then fetch() will get automatically called when an unknown property is accessed on an unfetched content object. Inherited From: RedditContent#fetch Returns: A version of this object with all of its fetched properties from reddit. This will not mutate the object. Once an object has been fetched once, its properties will be cached, so they might end up out-of-date if this function is called again. To refresh an object, use refresh().

In snoowrap, there are no exposed MoreComments objects; the objects returned by the reddit API are stripped from Listings and are used internally as sources for the fetchMore functions. This means that in snoowrap, Listings that contain Comments can be used/expanded in the same manner as Listings that don't contain Comments, and for the most part you don't have to worry about the distinction. (Incidentally, if you encounter a Listing that does contain a MoreComments object then it's a bug, so please report it.) new Listing() Extends Array Members isFinished :boolean A getter that indicates whether this Listing has any more items to fetch. Type: boolean Methods fetchMore(options) Fetches some more items Parameters: Name Type Description options object Properties Name Type Argument Default Description amount number The number of items to fetch. skipReplies boolean &lt;optional&gt; false For a Listing that contains comment objects on a Submission, this option can be used to save a few API calls, provided that only top-level comments are being examined. If this is set to true, snoowrap is able to fetch 100 Comments per API call rather than 20, but all returned Comments will have no fetched replies by default. Internal details: When skipReplies is set to true, snoowrap uses reddit's api/info endpoint to fetch Comments. When skipReplies is set to false, snoowrap uses reddit's api/morechildren endpoint. It's worth noting that reddit does not allow concurrent requests to the api/morechildren endpoint by the same account. append boolean &lt;optional&gt; true If true, the resulting Listing will contain the existing elements in addition to the newly-fetched elements. If false, the resulting Listing will only contain the newly-fetched elements. Returns: A new Listing containing the newly-fetched elements. If options.append is true, the new Listing will also contain all elements that were in the original Listing. Under most circumstances, the newly-fetched elements will appear at the end of the new Listing. However, if reverse pagination is enabled (i.e. if this Listing was created with a before query parameter), then the newly-fetched elements will appear at the beginning. In any case, continuity is maintained, i.e. the order of items in the Listing will be the same as the order in which they appear on reddit. Type Promise Example r.getHot({limit: 25}).then(myListing =&gt; { console.log(myListing.length); // =&gt; 25 myListing.fetchMore({amount: 10}).then(extendedListing =&gt; { console.log(extendedListing.length); // =&gt; 35 }) }); fetchAll( [options]) Fetches all of the items in this Listing, only stopping when there are none left. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options object &lt;optional&gt; Fetching options -- see Listing#fetchMore Returns: A new fully-fetched Listing. Keep in mind that this method has the potential to exhaust your ratelimit quickly if the Listing doesn't have a clear end (e.g. with posts on the front page), so use it with discretion. Type Promise Example r.getMe().getUpvotedContent().fetchAll().then(console.log) // =&gt; Listing [ Submission { ... }, Submission { ... }, ... ] × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.2 using the DocStrap template.
